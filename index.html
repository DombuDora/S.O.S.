    <p><P STYLE="background-color: #6a0c0c
; padding: 8px; border: double 7px #000000;">
    <strong>Friends & dance</strong></P>
    </p>

    <p><br> Without it id be gone
        <br> Gone as in heart dead
        <br> Depression, only seeing the dark side.</p>
    <p> Not my name gone
        <br> There would be me,
        <br> hiding in a perfect picture girl
        <br> Hiding behind beauty because my inside is ugly,
        <br> ugly and dead nothing more </p>
        
    <p><br><br> Without it,
    	<br> I would close up
        <br> I would have no reason to wake up
        <br> To live 
        <br> To face the ugly reality of this world</p>
    <p> I would close myself of from the world
        <br> so no one could come in,
        <br> not even air
        <br> But also so no one could come out
        <br> not even me </p>
        
    <p><br><br> Yet even with it
    	<br> I hide behind the skin 
        <br> so no one sees the dieing body underneath
        <br> Scared for anyone to see the real me
        <br> To see me like i do </p>
    <p> I circle in my thoughts like a tornado
    	<br> Unable to get myself out
        <br> Or let anyone else do so
        <br> The longer,
        <br> the more hurt i am,
        <br> and the harder it gets
        <br> But friends and dance pull me out
        <br> Though i push them aways with exhaustion </p>
        
    <p><br><br> That's why winterbreak kills me slowly </p>
    <p> Because no one pulls me out
        <br> Because i dont see the light in life anymore
        <br> Because i get socially exhausted
        <br> Because the days get shorter
        <br> and the dark nights full of thoughts get longer
        <br> trying to keep you
        <br> not wanting to let you go </p>
        
    <p> Because I don't have a reason to wake up
    	<br> Only to hide behind a person i don't know
        <br> To act happy and be around
        <br> Look alive and nothing more
        <br> Not for me
        <br> Only for the fate of my surroundings </p>
        
    <p><br><br> And what hurts the most, is that it's al my fault
    	<br> I can't blame anyone
        <br> It's not my parents who were abusive
        <br> It's not my friends that weren't really
        <br> It's not school who burns me out or past trauma </p>
    <p> They keep me standing
    	<br> and give me a purpose of living
        <br> I am the one hurting and killing myself
        <br> Eating me up untill nothing is left inside
        <br> Just the shell standing and keeping the truth covered
        <br> I can't walk away of the one hurting me
        <br> I can't blame, only myself </p>

    <strong> It's like a never ending tunnel 
    		<br> it just keeps going and going 
            <br> while you get deeper and deeper
            <br> starting to lose the sight of the entry
            <br> searching for the none existing exit.</strong></P>
